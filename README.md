## Overview
### Description
Helios is a Philips Hue lighting controller and programming app designed for the Philips Hue wireless LED colour-changing product line. Helios adds the ability for users to create and save their own custom effects.

### App Evaluation
- **Category:** Lifestyle
- **Mobile:** It does not use a lot of mobile features. But this app benefits from the portabilty of small handheld devices enabling the user the freedom to walk around their home as they set and observe lighting effects.
- **Story:** By adding the ability for the user to create their own effects, Helios would offer something that’s not on the market right now. It satisfies a need for a more pro-sumer use of the Philips Hue products.
- **Market:** Currently, this is a niche group. But as the technology (bulbs) become more affordable, we could see a boom of need for an app like this.
- **Habit:** Use is determined by user's needs and would range between multiple times a day to special occasion.
- **Scope:** The scope is three tiered and expandable based on our success. Tier I involves cloning existing functionality which would be well within our abilities. Tier II involves adding new features not available on the market right now. This will require our creativity. There may be a reason those features aren’t available. Tier III involves testing our product and adding new features and polish. This could be very difficult or easy, but we will not know until we get there.
